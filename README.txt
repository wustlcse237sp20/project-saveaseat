User stories completed this iteration:
A casual dining customer can go on the platform and make a reservation at a restaurant of their choosing quickly.
A restaurant on their platform can quickly check their reservation list and current capacity.
A restaurant looking to join the platform can join the platform.
A casual dining customer who needs to cancel their reservation can cancel their reservation or view their reservation details.

User stories to complete next iteration:
A customer is able to see available timeslots for each restaurant.
A restaurant is able to say no to a reservation if the restaurant will be at capacity at that time. 
New restaurants are stored in the platform, as are new reservations. 
A customer or restaurant is able to have a pleasant user experience.

Right now, all this functionality is implemented but the storage of information is not.  We tried several different ways that
did  not work and are planning on writing to a text file in JSON format for the next iteration in order to save the information.
